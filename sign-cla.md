Sign the CLA
============

This page is the step-by-step guide to signing our Individual Contributor License Agreement. As for now, the only option we provide for signing is for you to send us a pull request.

----

## 1. Fork and clone this repo

Please fork this repo and clone it to your local machine to create a pull request for signing. If you don't have your GitHub account, please sign up and make it.

## 2. Read the CLA and check the MD5 checksum of it

First and foremost, read [the current version of the CLA](cla.md). After reading the CLA, please check the MD5 checksum of the current CLA. The checksum will be needed in later steps.

```
$ md5sum cla.md
9b2380f756bcfcc53e4e8d20b01370e4 cla.md
```

## 3. Add your sign to the appropriate place

Now, this is the signing step. For signing, you need to make a single file to the `contributors/[CURRENT_CLA_CHECKSUM]` directory of this project. **If such directory does not exist, please make it**. **It can be occurred when the CLA is updated**. And then, name the file with the same name as your GitHub username, with `.md` appended to the end. For example, for the username `peter` and the checksum `9b2380f756bcfcc53e4e8d20b01370e4`, the full path to the file would be `contributors/9b2380f756bcfcc53e4e8d20b01370e4/peter.md`.

The single file should look like the following:

```
[DATE]

I hereby agree to the terms of the Individual Contributor License Agreement, with MD5 checksum [CURRENT_CLA_CHECKSUM].

I furthermore declare that I am authorized and able to make this agreement and sign this declaration.

Signed,

[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]
https://github.com/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]
```

Replace the bracketed text as follows:

* `[DATE]` with today's date, in the unambiguous numeric form `YYYY-MM-DD`.
* `[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]` with your GitHub username.
* `[CURRENT_CLA_CHECKSUM]` is the checksum you got in the step 2.

## 4. Create your pull request and wait for it to be merged

Create your pull request with the single file you added in the step 3, and wait for us to merge it. **Please note that the CLA can be updated in the future, and every time it is updated, you have to sign the new CLA**.
